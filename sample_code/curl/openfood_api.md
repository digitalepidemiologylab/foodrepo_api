## OpenFood API Endpoints

## OpenFood Product Model

### Fields

TBD

### The updated_at field

The **updated_at** field in the Products Elasticsearch index is the highest date of the products, images or product_nutrients collections, for a given product.


## Retrieve a Products Listing: products#index

Returns a list of products with default paging (50 products per page). It will return paging links and an index of the Nutrient and Image includes, but not the data.

```bash
curl -i -g -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```

[API_KEY]

### With Includes

It is possible to add the public urls for images associated with the products, as well as detailed nutrient information. To do this, pass a **nutrients[]=** parameter with the request. Examples are below.

#### Images

```bash
curl -i -g -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products?includes[]=images" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```

#### Nutrients

```bash
curl -i -g -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products?includes[]=nutrients'" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```

#### Both Images and Nutrients

```bash
curl -i -g -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products?includes[]=nutrients&includes[]=images'" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```

### Search by barcodes

It is possible to filter the results of **products#index** by barcodes. Filtering barcodes are passed in the array format.

```bash
curl -i -g -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products?barcodes[]=4104420034563&barcodes[]=4104420033764'" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```

This filter may be combined with the **includes** feature.

```bash
curl -i -g -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products?barcodes[]=4104420034563&barcodes[]=4104420033764&includes[]=nutrients&includes[]=images'" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```

#### Paging

##### Set Page Size

```
curl -i -g -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products?page[size]=50" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```

#### Access a specific page

```
curl -i -g -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products?page[size]=20&page[number]=5" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```


## Retrieve a single Product: products#show

### Call by Product ID

Add the product ID to the url.

```
curl -i -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products/972" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```

#### With Includes

The Includes feature functions the same way as for the **products#index** endpoint.

```
curl -i -g -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X GET "https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products/972?includes[]=nutrients&includes[]=images'" -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"'
```

## Search using Elasticsearch Query DSL

Full search ability is available against the **_search** endpoint. This endpoint provides access to all OpenFood Product data using the [ElasticSearch Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html).

### Limiting Fields

By default, the results from the **_search** endpoint will include all fields, included the **images** and **nutrients** nested endpoints. To limit fields, use the **includes** parameter against **_source**.

### Filtering

The **query** parameter is frequently used in searched. Full details are described in the [ElasticSearch Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html).

### Sorting

The sort order can be specified using the **sort** feature.

### Example Queries

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.openfood.ch/api/v3/products/_search -H 'Authorization: Token token="[API_KEY]"' -d'
